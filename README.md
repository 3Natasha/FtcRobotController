## NOTICE

This repository contains the public FTC SDK for the INTO THE DEEP (2024-2025) competition season.

## Welcome!
This GitHub repository contains the source code that is used to build an Android app to control a *FIRST* Tech Challenge competition robot.  To use this SDK, download/clone the entire project to your local computer.

## Requirements
To use this Android Studio project, you will need Android Studio Ladybug (2024.2) or later.

To program your robot in Blocks or OnBot Java, you do not need Android Studio.

## Getting Started
If you are new to robotics or new to the *FIRST* Tech Challenge, then you should consider reviewing the [FTC Blocks Tutorial](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/programming_resources/blocks/Blocks-Tutorial.html) to get familiar with how to use the control system:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[FTC Blocks Online Tutorial](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/programming_resources/blocks/Blocks-Tutorial.html)

Even if you are an advanced Java programmer, it is helpful to start with the [FTC Blocks tutorial](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/programming_resources/blocks/Blocks-Tutorial.html), and then migrate to the [OnBot Java Tool](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/programming_resources/onbot_java/OnBot-Java-Tutorial.html) or to [Android Studio](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/programming_resources/android_studio_java/Android-Studio-Tutorial.html) afterwards.

### Sample OpModes
This project contains a large selection of Sample OpModes (robot code examples) which can be cut and pasted into your /teamcode folder to be used as-is, or modified to suit your team's needs.

Samples Folder: &nbsp;&nbsp; [/FtcRobotController/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/robotcontroller/external/samples](FtcRobotController/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/robotcontroller/external/samples)

The readme.md file located in the [/TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode](TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode) folder contains an explanation of the sample naming convention, and instructions on how to copy them to your own project space.

# Release Information

## Version 10.1.1 (20241102-092223)

### Breaking Changes

* Support for Android Studio Ladybug.  Requires Android Studio Ladybug.  

### Known Issues

* Android Studio Ladybug's bundled JDK is version 21.  JDK 21 has deprecated support for Java 1.8, and Ladybug will warn on this deprecation.
  OnBotJava only supports Java 1.8, therefore, in order to ensure that software developed using Android Studio will 
  run within the OnBotJava environment, the targetCompatibility and sourceCompatibility versions for the SDK have been left at VERSION_1_8.
  FIRST has decided that until it can devote the resources to migrating OnBotJava to a newer version of Java, the deprecation is the 
  lesser of two non-optimal situations.

### Enhancements

* Added `toString()` method to Pose2D
* Added `toString()` method to SparkFunOTOS.Pose2D
